# ARM-Cortex-M-System-Drivers
•	Developed two full drivers for the ARM Cortex-M3/M4 architecture on TM4C microcontrollers as part of the final project.
•	SysTick Timer Driver: Initialized the SysTick Timer and implemented functions to start and stop the timer
•	Developed interrupt handlers and configured the SysTick Timer to generate interrupts at specific intervals.
•	NVIC System Driver: Handled TM4C microcontroller's edge-triggered interrupts. - Managed ARM Cortex-M3/M4 system exceptions: PendSV, SVC, and SysTick. 
•	Addressed ARM Cortex-M3/M4 fault exceptions: HardFault, UsageFault, BusFault, and Memory Management Fault.
